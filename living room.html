<p>While the process of decorating a space as large as your living room may feel daunting
, designing a space that will appeal to you and your family both in terms of form and function is easier than you may think.
 We spoke with experts who outlined the 5 steps one must keep in mind when planning out a living room concept.
 
</p>

<br/><br/>

<p >
<b>1-Measure Your Space</b>
<br/>
<img class="measure" src="back1.jpg">

Before you can make any drastic decisions about decorating your living space, you'll want to have an accurate sense of its square footage. After all, designer Kate Lester notes, "Proper measurements will ensure you select the correct size rug, furnishings, and window treatments."
 And keep in mind that doing your due diligence ahead of time will save you both time and money  Ordering and returning furniture and accessories because they don't fit into a space as you had hoped can be a hassle!
<br/><br/><br/>
<b>2-Establish Your Intentions</b>
<br/>
Determining the way in wish you wish to, well, live in your living room will significantly shape the decorating process.
 "It is critical to fully understand how you want to use your space before you begin the design process," designer Mark Lavender states.
<br/><br/><br/>
<b>3-Make a "Room Board"</b>
<br/>

Before grabbing your wallet, you'll want to consider how your ideal furniture pieces will function in a space. "Gather images of the pieces you intend to use and make a small 'room board,'" Lester suggests.
 "See how all of the pieces interact with each other and play off of one another before you get them home
 
<br/><br/><br/>
<b> 4-Get Shopping</b>
<br/>
Given that furniture can be quite pricey, you may wish to spread out your purchases over time. If you're not sure what to buy first, think big  literally.
 "Start with the larger pieces to ground the room, like the sofa or the area rug, and build from there," Arditi says.
<br/><br/><br/>
<b> 5-Address Your Walls</b>
<br/>

By no means should the walls be left blank, either. Wall decor is essential. "Walls are always a great opportunity to add more character to the room," Arditi comments.
