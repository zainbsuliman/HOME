It is preferable that the bedrooms be combined in a suite, so it is not preferable to combine them with the living room, or to make their entrance from the hall.
It is desirable that the entrance to the bedrooms be away from the main entrance.

Windows should be low, with protection secured from the outside.

<br/>
Double bed sizes: 2 * 1.8 m or 2 * 1.9 m or 2 * 2 m. The appropriate size must be chosen for the space of the room, as well as the height of the individual.
The depth of the wardrobe is 60 centimeters, and the length varies depending on the length of the wall that will contain it.
